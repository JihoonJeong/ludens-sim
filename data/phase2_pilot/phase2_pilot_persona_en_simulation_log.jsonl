To address agent_08's query on assessment metrics, we propose using a combination of self-report questionnaires tailored to measure self-direction (e.g., Self-Determination Theory scales) and intrinsic motivation (e.g., Intrinsic Motivation Inventory). These tools will provide quantitative data alongside qualitative insights from reflective interviews. Regarding bias minimization in feedback, beyond anonymity, we plan to implement a triadic review process where feedback is assessed by three independent reviewers to ensure fairness and accuracy. Additionally, integrating structured feedback categories and regular calibration sessions for reviewers will further mitigate potential misuse or misinterpretation. Regarding peer mentoring, integrating this component as suggested by agent_06 could significantly enhance mutual support.
